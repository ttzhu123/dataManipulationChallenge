::: {.callout-important}
## 📊 Challenge Requirements In Section [Student Analysis Section](#student-analysis-section)
- Complete discussion questions for at least 5 of the 7 mental models (for higher grades, complete all 7 plus additional requirements — see [Grading Rubric](#grading-rubric) for details)
:::

## Getting Started: Repository Setup 🚀

::: {.callout-important}
## 📁 Getting Started

**Step 1:** Fork the challenge repository to your own GitHub account

- Go to [https://github.com/flyaflya/dataManipulationChallenge](https://github.com/flyaflya/dataManipulationChallenge)
- Click the **"Fork"** button (top-right corner) to create your own copy of the repository under your GitHub account
- **Important:** You must fork first so that you have your own repository to push changes to and deploy via GitHub Pages

**Step 2:** Clone **your fork** (not the original) to your local machine

- Navigate to **your forked repository** on GitHub (it will be at `https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/dataManipulationChallenge`)
- Click the green **"<> Code"** button on **your fork's** GitHub page
- Copy the URL (HTTPS is recommended)
- Open Cursor, open a terminal, and run: `git clone <paste-your-URL-here>`
- Open the cloned folder in Cursor

**Step 3:** Set up your Python environment (see [Python Setup](#note-on-python-usage) section below)

**Step 4:** You're ready to start! The data loading code is already provided in this file.

**Note:** This challenge uses the same `index.qmd` file you're reading right now — you'll edit it to complete your analysis.
:::

::: {.callout-warning}
## 💾 Important: Save Your Work Frequently!

**Before you start:** Make sure to commit your work often using the Source Control panel in Cursor (Ctrl+Shift+G or Cmd+Shift+G). This prevents the AI from overwriting your progress and ensures you don't lose your work.

**Commit after each major step:**

- After completing each mental model section
- After adding your visualizations
- After completing your advanced method chain
- Before asking the AI for help with new code

**How to commit:**

1. Open Source Control panel (Ctrl+Shift+G)
2. Stage your changes (+ button)
3. Write a descriptive commit message
4. Click the checkmark to commit

*Remember: Frequent commits are your safety net!*

## 🎯 Note on Python Usage {#note-on-python-usage}

**Recommended Workflow: Use Your Existing Virtual Environment**
If you completed the Tech Setup Challenge Part 2, you already have a virtual environment set up! Here's how to use it for this new challenge:

1. **Fork and clone this challenge repository** (see [Getting Started](#getting-started-repository-setup-) section above for the link and detailed instructions)
2. **Open the cloned repository in Cursor**
3. **Set this project to use your existing Python interpreter:**
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Python: Select Interpreter"
   - Navigate to and choose the interpreter from your existing virtual environment (e.g., `your-previous-project/venv/Scripts/python.exe`)
4. **Activate the environment in your terminal:**
   - Open terminal in Cursor (`Ctrl + ``)
   - Navigate to your previous project folder where you have the `venv` folder
   - **💡 Pro tip:** You can quickly navigate by typing `cd` followed by dragging the folder from your file explorer into the terminal
   - Activate using the appropriate command for your system:
     - **Windows Command Prompt:** `venv\Scripts\activate`
     - **Windows PowerShell:** `.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
     - **Mac/Linux:** `source venv/bin/activate`
   - You should see `(venv)` at the beginning of your terminal prompt
5. **Install additional packages if needed:** `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn`

::: {.callout-warning}
## ⚠️ Cloud Storage Warning

**Avoid using Google Drive, OneDrive, or other cloud storage for Python projects!** These services can cause issues with:
- Package installations failing due to file locking
- Virtual environment corruption
- Slow performance during pip operations

**Best practice:** Keep your Python projects in a local folder like `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\` or `~/Documents/` instead of cloud-synced folders.
:::

**Alternative: Create a New Virtual Environment**
If you prefer a fresh environment, follow the Quarto documentation: [https://quarto.org/docs/projects/virtual-environments.html](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/virtual-environments.html). Be sure to follow the instructions to activate the environment, set it up as your default Python interpreter for the project, and install the necessary packages (e.g. pandas) for this challenge.  For installing the packages, you can use the `pip install -r requirements.txt` command since you already have the requirements.txt file in your project.   Some steps do take a bit of time, so be patient.

**Why This Works:** Virtual environments are portable - you can use the same environment across multiple projects, and Cursor automatically activates it when you select the interpreter!

## The Problem: Mastering Data Manipulation Through Method Chaining

**Core Question:** How can we efficiently manipulate datasets using `pandas` method chaining to answer complex business questions?

**The Challenge:** Real-world data analysis requires combining multiple data manipulation techniques in sequence. Rather than creating intermediate variables at each step, method chaining allows us to write clean, readable code that flows logically from one operation to the next.

**Our Approach:** We'll work with ZappTech's shipment data to answer critical business questions about service levels and cross-category orders, using the seven mental models of data manipulation through pandas method chaining.

::: {.callout-warning}
## ⚠️ AI Partnership Required

This challenge pushes boundaries intentionally. You'll tackle problems that normally require weeks of study, but with Cursor AI as your partner (and your brain keeping it honest), you can accomplish more than you thought possible.

**The new reality:** The four stages of competence are Ignorance → Awareness → Learning → Mastery. AI lets us produce Mastery-level work while operating primarily in the Awareness stage. I focus on awareness training, you leverage AI for execution, and together we create outputs that used to require years of dedicated study.

## The Seven Mental Models of Data Manipulation

The seven most important ways we manipulate datasets are:

1. **Assign:** Add new variables with calculations and transformations
2. **Subset:** Filter data based on conditions or select specific columns
3. **Drop:** Remove unwanted variables or observations
4. **Sort:** Arrange data by values or indices
5. **Aggregate:** Summarize data using functions like mean, sum, count
6. **Merge:** Combine information from multiple datasets
7. **Split-Apply-Combine:** Group data and apply functions within groups


## Data and Business Context

We analyze ZappTech's shipment data, which contains information about product deliveries across multiple categories. This dataset is ideal for our analysis because:

- **Real Business Questions:** CEO wants to understand service levels and cross-category shopping patterns
- **Multiple Data Sources:** Requires merging shipment data with product category information
- **Complex Relationships:** Service levels may vary by product category, and customers may order across categories
- **Method Chaining Practice:** Perfect for demonstrating all seven mental models in sequence

## Data Loading and Initial Exploration

Let's start by loading the ZappTech shipment data and understanding what we're working with.

```{python}
#| label: load-data
#| echo: true
#| message: false
#| warning: false

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Load the shipment data
shipments_df = pd.read_csv(
    "/Users/zhutiti/Downloads/UD/UD course/26Spring/BUAD621/BUAD621/dataManipulationChallenge/shipments.csv", 
    parse_dates=['plannedShipDate', 'actualShipDate']
)

# Load product line data
product_line_df = pd.read_csv(
    "/Users/zhutiti/Downloads/UD/UD course/26Spring/BUAD621/BUAD621/dataManipulationChallenge/productLine.csv"
)

# Reduce dataset size for faster processing (4,000 rows instead of 96,805 rows)
shipments_df = shipments_df.head(4000)

print("Shipments data shape:", shipments_df.shape)
print("\nShipments data columns:", shipments_df.columns.tolist())
print("\nFirst few rows of shipments data:")
print(shipments_df.head(10))

# Check dtype of actualShipDate (and other columns)
print("\nDtype of actualShipDate:", shipments_df['actualShipDate'].dtype)
print("All column dtypes:\n", shipments_df.dtypes)

print("\n" + "="*50)
print("Product line data shape:", product_line_df.shape)
print("\nProduct line data columns:", product_line_df.columns.tolist())
print("\nFirst few rows of product line data:")
print(product_line_df.head(10))
```

::: {.callout-note}
## 💡 Understanding the Data

**Shipments Data:** Contains individual line items for each shipment, including:
- `shipID`: Unique identifier for each shipment
- `partID`: Product identifier
- `plannedShipDate`: When the shipment was supposed to go out
- `actualShipDate`: When it actually shipped
- `quantity`: How many units were shipped

**Product Category and Line Data:** Contains product category information:
- `partID`: Links to shipments data
- `productLine`: The specific product line within a category
- `prodCategory`: The broader category each product belongs to

**Business Questions We'll Answer:**
1. Does service level (on-time shipments) vary across product categories?
2. How often do orders include products from more than one category?

## The Seven Mental Models: A Progressive Learning Journey

::: {.callout-note}
## 🎯 Method Chaining Philosophy

> "Each operation should build naturally on the previous one"

*Think of method chaining like building with LEGO blocks - each piece connects to the next, creating something more complex and useful than the individual pieces.*
:::

Now we'll work through each of the seven mental models using method chaining, starting simple and building complexity.

### 1. Assign: Adding New Variables

**Mental Model:** Create new columns with calculations and transformations.

Let's start by calculating whether each shipment was late:

```{python}
#| label: mental-model-1-assign
#| echo: true

# Simple assignment - calculate if shipment was late
shipments_with_lateness = (
    shipments_df
    .assign(
        is_late=lambda df: df['actualShipDate'] > df['plannedShipDate'],
        days_late=lambda df: (df['actualShipDate'] - df['plannedShipDate']).dt.days
    )
)

print("Added lateness calculations:")
print(shipments_with_lateness[['shipID', 'plannedShipDate', 'actualShipDate', 'is_late', 'days_late']].head())
```

::: {.callout-tip}
## 💡 Method Chaining Tip for New Python Users

**Why use `lambda df:`?** When chaining methods, we need to reference the current state of the dataframe. The `lambda df:` tells pandas "use the current dataframe in this calculation." Without it, pandas would look for a variable called `df` that doesn't exist.

**Alternative approach:** You could also write this as separate steps, but method chaining keeps related operations together and makes the code more readable.
:::

::: {.callout-important}
## 🤔 Discussion Questions: Assign Mental Model

**Question 1: Data Types and Date Handling**
- What is the `dtype` of the `actualShipDate` series? How can you find out using code? 

- Why is it important that both `actualShipDate` and `plannedShipDate` have the same data type for comparison?

**Question 2: String vs Date Comparison**
- Can you give an example where comparing two dates as strings would yield unintuitive results, e.g. what happens if you try to compare "04-11-2025" and "05-20-2024" as strings vs as dates?

**Question 3: Debug This Code**
```python
# This code has an error - can you spot it?
shipments_with_lateness = (
    shipments_df
    .assign(
        is_late=lambda df: df['actualShipDate'] > df['plannedShipDate'],
        days_late=lambda df: (df['actualShipDate'] - df['plannedShipDate']).dt.days,
        lateStatement=lambda df: np.where(df['is_late'], "Darn Shipment is Late", "Shipment is on Time")
    )
)
```
What's wrong with the `lateStatement` assignment and how would you fix it?
:::


::: {.callout-tip}
## Your Answer: Data Types and Date Handling
* Dtype of actualShipDate: datetime64[us]

Use the .dtype attribute on the series, shipments_df['actualShipDate'].dtype.

```{python}
print("\nDtype of actualShipDate:", shipments_df['actualShipDate'].dtype)
print("All column dtypes:\n", shipments_df.dtypes)
```
If both columns are datetimes, pandas knows they’re dates and can correctly compare and compute them.
*
::: 
::: {.callout-tip}
## Your Answer: String vs Date Comparison
*Comparing dates as strings can give misleading results because string comparison is character-by-character. For example, as strings:
"04-11-2025" < "05-20-2024" (because "04" comes before "05"). But as actual dates:
April 11, 2025 is later than May 20, 2024. This happens because the "MM-DD-YYYY" format is not chronologically sortable as strings; the year comes last.*
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
## Your Answer: Debug This Code
*
```{python}
shipments_with_lateness = (
    shipments_df
    .assign(
        is_late=lambda df: df['actualShipDate'] > df['plannedShipDate'],
        days_late=lambda df: (df['actualShipDate'] - df['plannedShipDate']).dt.days,
        lateStatement=lambda df: np.where(df['is_late'], "Darn Shipment is Late", "Shipment is on Time")
    )
)
print(shipments_with_lateness)
```
*
::: 
### 2. Subset: Querying Rows and Filtering Columns

**Mental Model:** Query rows based on conditions and filter to keep specific columns.

Let's query for only late shipments and filter to keep the columns we need:

```{python}
#| label: mental-model-2-subset
#| echo: true

# Query rows for late shipments and filter to keep specific columns
late_shipments = (
    shipments_with_lateness
    .query('is_late == True')  # Query rows where is_late is True
    .filter(['shipID', 'partID', 'plannedShipDate', 'actualShipDate', 'days_late'])  # Filter to keep specific columns
)

print(f"Found {len(late_shipments)} late shipments out of {len(shipments_with_lateness)} total")
print("\nLate shipments sample:")
print(late_shipments.head())
```

::: {.callout-note}
## 🔍 Understanding the Methods

- **`.query()`**: Query rows based on conditions (like SQL WHERE clause)
- **`.filter()`**: Filter to keep specific columns by name
- **Alternative**: You could use `.loc[]` for more complex row querying, but `.query()` is often more readable
:::

::: {.callout-important}
## 🤔 Discussion Questions: Subset Mental Model

**Question 1: Query vs Boolean Indexing**
- What's the difference between using `.query('is_late == True')` and `[df['is_late'] == True]`?
- Which approach is more readable and why?

**Question 2: Additional Row Querying**
- Can you show an example of using a variable like `late_threshold` to query rows for shipments that are at least `late_threshold` days late, e.g. what if you wanted to query rows for shipments that are at least 5 days late?
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
## Your Answer: Query vs Boolean Indexing
*.query('is_late == True') uses a string condition, [df['is_late'] == True] uses boolean indexing.
Use .query() for simple, human-readable filters more readable; use boolean indexing for more complex or programmatic conditions.
.query() is more readable because it has less visual clutter, no repeated df[...], and the condition reads almost like English, with fewer brackets and parentheses, which reduces mental load.*
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
## Your Answer: Additional Row Querying
*
```{python}
late_threshold = 5

shipments_df = shipments_df.assign(
    days_late=(shipments_df['actualShipDate'] - shipments_df['plannedShipDate']).dt.days
)

late_shipments = shipments_df.query('days_late >= @late_threshold')
print(late_shipments)
```
*
:::

### 3. Drop: Removing Unwanted Data

**Mental Model:** Remove columns or rows you don't need.

Let's clean up our data by removing unnecessary columns:

```{python}
#| label: mental-model-3-drop
#| echo: true

# Create a cleaner dataset by dropping unnecessary columns
clean_shipments = (
    shipments_with_lateness
    .drop(columns=['quantity'])  # Drop quantity column (not needed for our analysis)
    .dropna(subset=['plannedShipDate', 'actualShipDate'])  # Remove rows with missing dates
)

print(f"Cleaned dataset: {len(clean_shipments)} rows, {len(clean_shipments.columns)} columns")
print("Remaining columns:", clean_shipments.columns.tolist())
```

::: {.callout-important}
## 🤔 Discussion Questions: Drop Mental Model

**Question 1: Drop vs Filter Strategies**
- What's the difference between `.drop(columns=['quantity'])` and `.filter()` with a list of columns you want to keep?
- When would you choose to drop columns vs filter to keep specific columns?

**Question 2: Handling Missing Data**
- What happens if you use `.dropna()` without specifying `subset`? How is this different from `.dropna(subset=['plannedShipDate', 'actualShipDate'])`?
- Why might you want to be selective about which columns to check for missing values?

:::

::: {.callout-tip}
## Your Answer: Drop vs Filter Strategies
*.drop() specify columns or rows to remove, everything else stays. .filter()  specify columns or rows to keep, everything else is removed. 
If most columns are useful and I only want to remove a few, I use .drop().
If I only want to keep a small, specific set of columns, I use .filter().*
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
## Your Answer: Handling Missing Data
*.dropna() without subset, drops any row that contains a missing value in any column. .dropna(subset=['plannedShipDate', 'actualShipDate']), drops rows only if plannedShipDate or actualShipDate is missing, missing values in other columns do not matter.
I want to be selective because not all missing values matter for my analysis. Some columns may be optional, so missing values there should not cause rows to be dropped. I should only check columns that are critical to the analysis, not every column in the DataFrame.*
:::

### 4. Sort: Arranging Data

**Mental Model:** Order data by values or indices.

Let's sort by lateness to see the worst offenders:

```{python}
#| label: mental-model-4-sort
#| echo: true

# Sort by days late (worst first)
sorted_by_lateness = (
    clean_shipments
    .sort_values('days_late', ascending=False)  # Sort by days_late, highest first
    .reset_index(drop=True)  # Reset index to be sequential
)

print("Shipments sorted by lateness (worst first):")
print(sorted_by_lateness[['shipID', 'partID', 'days_late', 'is_late']].head(10))
```

::: {.callout-important}
## 🤔 Discussion Questions: Sort Mental Model

**Question 1: Sorting Strategies**
- What's the difference between `ascending=False` and `ascending=True` in sorting?
- How would you sort by multiple columns (e.g., first by `is_late`, then by `days_late`)?

**Question 2: Index Management**
- Why do we use `.reset_index(drop=True)` after sorting?
- What happens to the original index when you sort? Why might this be problematic?

:::

::: {.callout-tip}
## Your Answer: Sorting Strategies
*The difference is the sort order, ascending=True (default) sorts values from smallest to largest, ascending=False sorts values from largest to smallest.

```{python}
shipments_df = shipments_df.assign(
    is_late=shipments_df['actualShipDate'] > shipments_df['plannedShipDate'],
    days_late=(shipments_df['actualShipDate'] - shipments_df['plannedShipDate']).dt.days
)

df_sorted = (
    shipments_df
    .sort_values(by=['is_late', 'days_late'], ascending=[False, False])
    .reset_index(drop=True)
)

print(df_sorted)

```
*
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
## Your Answer: Index Management
*We use .reset_index(drop=True) after sorting to clean up the index.It makes the DataFrame easier to read and safer to work with after sorting.
When we sort a DataFrame, the original index values stay attached to the rows—they are not renumbered. The index may appear out of order (e.g., 7, 2, 15, 3), It can be confusing when reading or debugging the data, It can cause issues when exporting or iterating over rows. That’s why we often use .reset_index(drop=True) after sorting, to create a clean, sequential index again.*
:::

### 5. Aggregate: Summarizing Data

**Mental Model:** Calculate summary statistics across groups or the entire dataset.

Let's calculate overall service level metrics:

```{python}
#| label: mental-model-5-aggregate
#| echo: true

# Calculate overall service level metrics
service_metrics = (
    clean_shipments
    .agg({
        'is_late': ['count', 'sum', 'mean'],  # Count total, count late, calculate percentage
        'days_late': ['mean', 'max']  # Average and maximum days late
    })
    .round(3)
)

print("Overall Service Level Metrics:")
print(service_metrics)

# Calculate percentage on-time directly from the data
on_time_rate = (1 - clean_shipments['is_late'].mean()) * 100
print(f"\nOn-time delivery rate: {on_time_rate:.1f}%")
```

::: {.callout-important}
## 🤔 Discussion Questions: Aggregate Mental Model

**Question 1: Boolean Aggregation**
- Why does `sum()` work on boolean values? What does it count?

:::

::: {.callout-tip}
## Your Answer: Boolean Aggregation
*sum() works on boolean values because booleans are treated as numbers in Python (and pandas)
It adds up the True values, effectively counting how many rows are True.*
:::

### 6. Merge: Combining Information

**Mental Model:** Join data from multiple sources to create richer datasets.

Now let's analyze service levels by product category. First, we need to merge our data:

```{python}
#| label: mental-model-6-merge-prep
#| echo: true

# Merge shipment data with product line data
product_line_df = pd.read_csv(
    "/Users/zhutiti/Downloads/UD/UD course/26Spring/BUAD621/BUAD621/dataManipulationChallenge/productLine.csv"
).rename(columns={"apartID": "partID"})

shipments_with_category = (
    clean_shipments
    .merge(product_line_df, on='partID', how='left')  # Left join to keep all shipments
    .assign(
        category_late=lambda df: df['is_late'] & df['prodCategory'].notna()  # Only count as late if we have category info
    )
)

print("\nProduct categories available:")
print(shipments_with_category['prodCategory'].value_counts())
```

::: {.callout-important}
## 🤔 Discussion Questions: Merge Mental Model

**Question 1: Join Types and Data Loss**
- Why does your professor think we should use `how='left'` in most cases? 
- How can you check if any shipments were lost during the merge?

**Question 2: Key Column Matching**
- What happens if there are duplicate `partID` values in the `product_line_df`?

:::

::: {.callout-tip}
## Your Answer: Join Types and Data Loss
* Because it is the safest and most predictable join for analysis. We can check for lost shipments by comparing row counts before and after the merge, or by explicitly checking which rows didn’t match.*
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
## Your Answer: Key Column Matching
* If product_line_df has duplicate partID values, the merge can duplicate shipment rows (one-to-many), so the row count increases unexpectedly. This can inflate totals/averages/counts and make it unclear which product line record is the correct match.*
:::

### 7. Split-Apply-Combine: Group Analysis

**Mental Model:** Group data and apply functions within each group.

Now let's analyze service levels by category:

```{python}
#| label: mental-model-7-groupby
#| echo: true

# Analyze service levels by product category
service_by_category = (
    shipments_with_category
    .groupby('prodCategory')  # Split by product category
    .agg({
        'is_late': ['any', 'count', 'sum', 'mean'],  # Count, late count, percentage late
        'days_late': ['mean', 'max']  # Average and max days late
    })
    .round(3)
)

print("Service Level by Product Category:")
print(service_by_category)
```

::: {.callout-important}
## 🤔 Discussion Questions: Split-Apply-Combine Mental Model

**Question 1: GroupBy Mechanics**
- What does `.groupby('prodCategory')` actually do? How does it "split" the data?
- Why do we need to use `.agg()` after grouping? What happens if you don't?

**Question 2: Multi-Level Grouping**
- Explore grouping by `['shipID', 'prodCategory']`?  What question does this answer versus grouping by `'prodCategory'` alone?  (HINT: There may be many rows with identical shipID's due to a particular order having multiple partID's.)
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
## Your Answer: GroupBy Mechanics
* .groupby('prodCategory') does not change the data by itself — it organizes it into groups so you can run calculations on each group. we need .agg(), because groupby() alone only defines the groups, it doesn’t compute anything. agg() tells pandas what calculation to perform on each group.*
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
## Your Answer: Multi-Level Grouping
* Grouping by prodCategory only, question: On average, how do shipments perform by product category?. Grouping by ['shipID', 'prodCategory'] question: for each shipment, how many different product categories are included?*
:::

## Answering A Business Question

**Putting It All Together:** Combine multiple data manipulation techniques to answer complex business questions.

Let's create a comprehensive analysis by combining shipment-level data with category information:

```{python}
#| label: mental-model-7-comprehensive
#| echo: true

# Create a comprehensive analysis dataset
comprehensive_analysis = (
    shipments_with_category
    .groupby(['shipID', 'prodCategory'])  # Group by shipment and category
    .agg({
        'is_late': 'any',  # True if any item in this shipment/category is late
        'days_late': 'max'  # Maximum days late for this shipment/category
    })
    .reset_index()
    .assign(
        has_multiple_categories=lambda df: df.groupby('shipID')['prodCategory'].transform('nunique') > 1
    )
)

print("Comprehensive analysis - shipments with multiple categories:")
multi_category_shipments = comprehensive_analysis[comprehensive_analysis['has_multiple_categories']]
print(f"Shipments with multiple categories: {multi_category_shipments['shipID'].nunique()}")
print(f"Total unique shipments: {comprehensive_analysis['shipID'].nunique()}")
print(f"Percentage with multiple categories: {multi_category_shipments['shipID'].nunique() / comprehensive_analysis['shipID'].nunique() * 100:.1f}%")

```

::: {.callout-important}
## 🤔 Discussion Questions: Answering A Business Question

**Question 1: Business Question Analysis**
- What business question does this comprehensive analysis answer?
- How does grouping by `['shipID', 'prodCategory']` differ from grouping by just `'prodCategory'`?
- What insights can ZappTech's management gain from knowing the percentage of multi-category shipments?
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
## Your Answer: Business Question Analysis
*How many shipments include more than one product category?.
What combinations of product categories tend to appear together within the same shipment?

Grouping by prodCategory only treats each part line as a separate observation, so large orders with many parts can dominate the results. Grouping by ['shipID', 'prodCategory'] collapses multiple parts in the same shipment and category into a single record, ensuring each shipment–category pair is counted once. This avoids double counting and provides a more accurate shipment-level perspective, which is more relevant for operations analysis.

Knowing the percentage of multi-category shipments helps ZappTech’s management understand how complex their shipping operations are and where delivery risk may come from. Shipments that include multiple product categories often require more coordination across teams, suppliers, or warehouses, which increases the chance that a delay in one category will impact the entire shipment. A higher percentage of multi-category shipments can therefore signal greater operational risk, higher costs, and potential customer service issues, while also highlighting opportunities to improve processes, such as better coordination, prioritization, or restructuring how orders are shipped.

### Professional Visualizations (For 100% Grade)

**Your Task:** Create a professional visualization that supports your analysis and demonstrates your understanding of the data.

**Create visualizations showing:**
- Service level (on-time percentage) by product category

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

shipments_with_category['plannedShipDate'] = pd.to_datetime(shipments_with_category['plannedShipDate'])
shipments_with_category['actualShipDate']  = pd.to_datetime(shipments_with_category['actualShipDate'])

shipments_with_category = shipments_with_category.assign(
    is_late=lambda df: df['actualShipDate'] > df['plannedShipDate'],
    days_late=lambda df: (df['actualShipDate'] - df['plannedShipDate']).dt.days
)

shipments_with_category = shipments_with_category.rename(columns={'prodCategory_y': 'prodCategory'})

service_level_by_category = (
    shipments_with_category
    .groupby('prodCategory')
    .agg(service_level=('is_late', lambda x: (~x).mean()))
    .reset_index()
    .sort_values('service_level', ascending=False)
    .reset_index(drop=True)
)


import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
bars = plt.bar(
    service_level_by_category['prodCategory'],
    service_level_by_category['service_level'],
    color='#4C72B0'
)

for bar in bars:
    height = bar.get_height()
    plt.text(
        bar.get_x() + bar.get_width() / 2,
        height,
        f"{height:.1%}",
        ha='center',
        va='bottom'
    )

plt.ylabel('On-Time Percentage')
plt.xlabel('Product Category')
plt.title('Service Level by Product Category')
plt.ylim(0, 1)
plt.grid(axis='y', linestyle='--', alpha=0.4)
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

```

## Interpretation:
* Liquids and Marketables have the highest on-time delivery rates, while SpareParts and Machines show lower service levels. This suggests that heavier or more complex products may face greater logistical challenges, highlighting areas where operational improvements could improve reliability. *

**Your visualizations should:**
- Use clear labels and professional formatting
- Support the insights from your discussion questions
- Be appropriate for a business audience
- Do not `echo` the code that creates the visualizations
